# text_color_coding
 
Project "Text_color" contains app to translate text into color code. 
<ol>
    <li>Yes! It's work! Currently, app can translates texts (only English and Russian) into color squares. However, I not have interest ideas about coding algorithms. I have created primitive dictionary with random pairs <b>"letter - color"</b>.</li>
    <li>Added 'try - except' block for coding string. The goal of this block is cathing KeyError.</li>
</ol>
